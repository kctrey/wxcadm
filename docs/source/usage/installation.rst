Installation
============
**wxcadm** isn't yet available as a PIP package. To install, simply download/pull the ``wxcadm.py`` and ``exceptions.py``
files from `GitHub <https://github.com/kctrey/wxcadm>`_ and put them in your PATH, usually the root directory of your script.

**wxcadm** attempts to use only standard Python libraries. The only library that is needed that may need to be installed
is the `Requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_ library.
