===============
Most of the classes and methods you will find here aren't meant to be called directly. The classes listed under the
REFERENCE section in the table of contents are the ones that you need to perform almost any action. This documentation
is provided as a view under the hood of the module for those interested in enhancing **wxcadm**.
